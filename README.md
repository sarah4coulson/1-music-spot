# Project 1: Music Spot

## Description

The purpose of this project was to use newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. Through the collaborative efforts of Group 2, we have created a web application that uses data from multiple server-side API requests to allow users to search different music genres and have artists returned for that specific genre.
