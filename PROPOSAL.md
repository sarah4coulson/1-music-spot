## Project Description

## User Story

As a music consumer.

I want to search for a specific genre of music and see the top artists according to multiple libraries.

So that I can see who is the most popular according to hits played in that specific genre.

Given how I start with no knowledge of the top artist across the different libraries.

When I search for a genre I want the top five most played artists on all the libraries to be displayed.

Then I will be able to see who is the best across all the libraries and pick who I want to try and listen to next.
